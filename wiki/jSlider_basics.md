My goal for this page is to help you understand how I've structured jSlider and the logic used for its features.

## Table of Contents

1. Structure

2. Image Sliding
  - queue
  - pause
  - nav buttons

## Structure

jSlider is structured in the following manner:

```
Slider Container
  Slider
    Frame
      Image
    Frame
      Image
    Frame
      Image
```

Here is a gif I've made to help visualize the structure of jSlider:
