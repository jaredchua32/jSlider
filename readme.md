# jcSlider

I've always been amazed by the sliders that people make - so I thought: "Hey, I should make my own slider."

I created jcSlider to help familiarize myself with even more JavaScript, jQuery, and CSS concepts and best practices. In addition, I have several artist friends whom would like their work to be showcased!

## Features

### Responsive Image Slider

jcSlider is written to be fully responsive no matter where in your page it is placed.

### Fully-Customizable

jcSlider's options can easily be overwritten globally for all sliders or on a per-instance basis. Please visit the [Configuring jcSlider's Options](https://github.com/jaredchua32/jcSlider/wiki/Configuring-jcSlider's-Options) page in the wiki for more information.

### jcSlider Will Display ANY Image!

The images you give to jcSlider do not need to have the same dimensions. jcSlider will automatically display them elegantly.

## For Developers

I learned **a lot** while making jcSlider. My hope is to share not only the plugin, but also some of the knowledge that I have gained from this project. Please visit the [jcSlider Basics](https://github.com/jaredchua32/jcSlider/wiki/jcSlider-Basics) wiki page to see how jcSlider works.

## Installation

Please visit the [Using jcSlider](https://github.com/jaredchua32/jcSlider/wiki/Using-jcSlider) wiki page in the wiki for full details on how to install, configure, and use jcSlider for your projects or applications.
