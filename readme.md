# JSlider

I've always been amazed by the sliders that people make - so I thought: "Hey, I should make my own slider."

I created JSlider to help familiarize myself with even more JavaScript, jQuery, and CSS concepts and best practices. In addition, I have several artist friends whom would like their work to be showcased!

## Features

### Responsive Image Slider

JSlider is written to be fully responsive no matter where in your page it is placed.

### Fully-Customizable

JSlider's options can easily be overwritten globally for all sliders or on a per-instance basis. Please visit the [Configuring jSlider's Options](https://github.com/jaredchua32/jSlider/wiki/Configuring-jSlider's-Options) page in the wiki for more information.

### jSlider Will Display ANY Image!

The images you give to JSlider do not need to have the same dimensions. jSlider will automatically display them elegantly.

## For Developers

I learned **a lot** while making jSlider. My hope is to share not only the plugin, but also some of the knowledge that I have gained from this project. Please visit the [jSlider Basics](https://github.com/jaredchua32/jSlider/wiki/jSlider-Basics) wiki page to see how jSlider works.

## Installation

Please visit the [Using jSlider](https://github.com/jaredchua32/jSlider/wiki/Using-jSlider) wiki page in the wiki for more information on how to install, configure, and use jSlider for your projects or applications.
