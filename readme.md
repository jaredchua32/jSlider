# JSlider

I've always been amazed by the sliders that people make. As a photographer and JavaScript developer, I have even more reasons as to why I should make my own slider.

I created JSlider to help familiarize myself with even more JavaScript, jQuery, and CSS concepts and best practices. In addition, I have several artist friends whom would like their work to be showcased.

## Features

### Responsive Image Slider

JSlider is written to be fully responsive no matter where in your page it is positioned.

### Fully-Customizable

JSlider's options can easily be overwritten on a per-instance or global basis. Please visit the [Customizing JSlider]() page in the wiki for more information.

### Automatic Image Resizing

The images you give to JSlider don't have to be the same size. Because most of the styling is put where it should be, in the stylesheet, there is even less impact on performance and memory use!

### Built-in Features

JSlider comes with many built-in features such as automatic side scroll buttons and navigation buttons. JSlider also pauses itself when an image slide or slider navigation occurs.
